    "text": "University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom (Level 4 - 1st Year)\nAbstract: The irrigation system allows water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone, through a solenoid valve. However, it is found that the market price of the system is expensive for small area coverage. Thus, this paper proposes a design for a smart home garden irrigation system that implements ready-to-use, energy-efficient, and cost-effective devices. Raspberry Pi, which is implemented in this system is integrated with multi-sensors such as soil moisture sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and light sensors. This proposed system managed to reduce cost, minimize wastewater, and reduce the physical human interface. In this paper, the relay is utilized to control the switching of the solenoid valve. The system also managed to measure the moisture of the soil and control the solenoid valve according to human requirements. It is conducted with Graphical User Interface (GUI) using an Android application to activate watering activity. Email notification is also sent to the home user for alert purposes either for normal or critical operations. An experimental setup has been tested and it is proven that the system can intelligently control and monitor the soil moisture levels in the experiment field.\nTechnologies Used: Ubidots cloud, Arduino, ESP8266 NodeMCU, Android, C++, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Java Script, JSON, jQuery UI, REST Web Services\n\n\n\nAbstract: In Sri Lanka, agriculture plays an important role in the development of food production. In our country, agriculture depends on monsoons which are not a sufficient source of water. So irrigation is used in the agriculture field.

The objective of this paper is aiming to overcome this challenge, the whole system is microcontroller based and can be operated from a remote location through wireless transmission so there is no need to be concerned about irrigation timing as per crop or soil condition. The sensor is used to take sensor readings of soil like soil moisture, temperature, and air moisture, and decision-making is controlled by the user (farmer) by using a microcontroller. The data received from sensors are sent to the server database using wireless transmission. The irrigation will be automated when the moisture and temperature of the field are reduced.

    "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious illness that mostly affects the lungs. Tuberculosis bacteria spread from person to person by small droplets sprayed into the air by coughs and sneezes. When someone with untreated, active TB coughs, talks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings, this might happen. Although TB is infectious, it is difficult to catch. You are significantly more likely to catch TB from someone with whom you live or work than from a stranger. Most persons with active tuberculosis who have had adequate medication therapy for at least two weeks are no longer infectious. There are some Tuberculosis infected areas that are small enough to be inviable to the naked eye and Chest X-ray images of Tuberculosis are frequently wrongly categorized with other diseases with similar radiologic patterns, which can lead to patients who received incorrect medication and worsen their health. Although hospitals in Sri Lanka have well-trained and professional personnel, they lack cutting-edge equipment, which may cause the diagnosing process to be slowed.

Currently, Cardiologists and Cardiothoracic surgeons are manually reviewing the clinical reports, especially patients’ echocardiography reports to diagnose the cardiovascular clinical stage of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Although, there are several ways have been made to automate this cardiovascular clinical process to extract information from clinical reports, especially from echocardiography reports, currently, there are limited research studies for analyzing cardiovascular clinical trials. This research study focused on establishing some baseline performance measures using a 1- dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and determining strategies for improving classification precision. Currently, we are in the first stage of development of the application. The deep learning model results were promising but were unable to exceed precision or F-scores of 80% for mild, moderate, or severe LVEF; irrespective of how the training data was sampled, how deeply connected the neural network layers were, or well the model was tuned.

    "text": "Thesis Abstract\nCardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death around the world and remains a major public health problem. Apart from that, early-stage cardiovascular disease diagnosis and cardiovascular disease prediction also signify a major concern in public health. Most of the time, misdiagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a very common occurrence throughout the world, for cardio specialists. This platform consists with main three main modules, which are web dashboard application, machine learning module, and machine learning web service modules. The machine learning module is based on an Artificial Neural network that was designed using the TensorFlow Machine Learning framework. The web dashboard was designed using the Flask framework and which allows the end user to input clinical variables for diagnosing the process for predicting the cardiovascular risk stage. The machine learning web service module was based on REST web services that handle the request-reply between the ML module and the frontend dashboard. The evaluation of the proposed machine learning classifier model performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) in this research study showed that the proposed model predicted the class label correctly (above 73%). More than seventy-three percent of respondents (including cardio specialists) who participated in the evaluation session agreed strongly agreed that this research followed medical procedures and that the result can support early-stage cardiovascular disease diagnosis analysis."
