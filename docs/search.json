    "text": "University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom (Level 4 - 1st Year)\nAbstract: The irrigation system allows water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone, through a solenoid valve. However, it is found that the market price of the system is expensive for small area coverage. Thus, this paper proposes a design for a smart home garden irrigation system that implements ready-to-use, energy-efficient, and cost-effective devices. Raspberry Pi, which is implemented in this system is integrated with multi-sensors such as soil moisture sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and light sensors. This proposed system managed to reduce cost, minimize wastewater, and reduce the physical human interface. In this paper, the relay is utilized to control the switching of the solenoid valve. The system also managed to measure the moisture of the soil and control the solenoid valve according to human requirements. It is conducted with Graphical User Interface (GUI) using an Android application to activate watering activity. Email notification is also sent to the home user for alert purposes either for normal or critical operations. An experimental setup has been tested and it is proven that the system can intelligently control and monitor the soil moisture levels in the experiment field.\nTechnologies Used: Ubidots cloud, Arduino, ESP8266 NodeMCU, Android, C++, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Java Script, JSON, jQuery UI, REST Web Services\n\n\n\nAbstract: In Sri Lanka, agriculture plays an important role in the development of food production. In our country, agriculture depends on monsoons which are not a sufficient source of water. So irrigation is used in the agriculture field. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a milestone in the evolution of technology. IoT plays an important role in many fields, one of that is Agriculture by which it can feed billions of people on Earth in the future. The objective of this paper is aiming to overcome this challenge, the whole system is microcontroller based and can be operated from a remote location through wireless transmission so there is no need to be concerned about irrigation timing as per crop or soil condition. The sensor is used to take sensor readings of soil like soil moisture, temperature, and air moisture, and decision-making is controlled by the user (farmer) by using a microcontroller. The data received from sensors are sent to the server database using wireless transmission. The irrigation will be automated when the moisture and temperature of the field are reduced. The farmer is notified with the information regarding field conditions through mobile periodically. This system will be more useful in areas where there is a scarcity of water and will be worth efficient in satisfying its requirements.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Westminster, London, United Kingdom (Level 5 - 2nd Year)\nIrrigation system features: * remotely controlled water pump * Automatic/manual mode * humidity and water pump status display * Irrigation can be triggered in the Web user interface.

    "text": "The rationale for sharing scientific code is both clear and deeply impactful. Making code publicly available does more than just allow other researchers to replicate results—it transforms the very foundation of scientific inquiry. By providing access to the underlying mechanics of their research, scientists enable their peers to validate and extend their findings, fostering a collaborative environment that is built on a bedrock of transparency and trust.\nThis open approach significantly enhances the credibility of the research. When code is accessible, it invites scrutiny and peer review, ensuring that the methods employed are robust and reliable. This transparency not only strengthens the findings but also builds the reputation of the researchers, who are seen as contributors to a cooperative scientific community.\nMoreover, sharing code accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. It allows researchers around the world to build directly on existing work, rather than duplicating efforts or starting from scratch. This is particularly crucial in fields where progression is fast and timely advancements are essential. Openly available code can be adapted and extended for new experiments and applications, broadening the impact of the original work and sparking innovation. This iterative process of improvement and expansion is central to the scientific method, driving the field forward at a pace that would be unattainable in a more closed research environment.\nIn sum, the practice of sharing scientific code nurtures a more dynamic and responsive scientific ecosystem. It underpins a culture of openness and continuous improvement, where knowledge is freely shared and collective progress is valued above individual achievement. This culture not only speeds up the advancement of science but also ensures that it is more accurate, reproducible, and transparent.\n\n\n\nJeff Leek stresses the significance of utilizing public, shareable, and version-controlled platforms such as GitHub and Bitbucket for distributing scientific code. These platforms are not merely repositories but integral tools that enhance collaborative science. They offer straightforward interfaces that simplify the process of accessing code for scientists globally, ensuring that research can be built upon without geographical or institutional barriers. Additionally, their robust version control systems are critical for managing the development of projects over time. This functionality records each change made to the codebase, providing a transparent audit trail that allows researchers to trace the evolution of their work, revert to previous versions if necessary, and understand the context of each modification. This capability is crucial not only for maintaining the integrity of the code but also for debugging and refining the work as new data or methods become available.\nBeyond general platforms, Leek advocates for the use of specialized, curated repositories for distributing software intended for wider community use. This advice is particularly pertinent when the software in question has broader applications or requires rigorous validation. Repositories like CRAN for R, Bioconductor for bioinformatics tools, and PyPI for Python packages play a pivotal role in the dissemination of scientific software. These platforms not only provide a centralized location for accessing software but also incorporate peer review processes that vet the submissions for quality and functionality. This peer review mechanism enhances the credibility and reliability of the software, which is crucial for fostering trust and adoption within the scientific community. By ensuring that software meets a high standard of quality and usability, these repositories help to establish a foundation of reliable tools that researchers can confidently use to advance their own work.\nOverall, the strategic use of both general and specialized platforms for code sharing aligns with the broader goals of open science. It ensures that valuable scientific tools are preserved, enhanced, and made accessible to the widest possible audience, thereby amplifying the impact and utility of individual contributions to the global scientific endeavor.\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness of sharing scientific code is significantly amplified by thorough documentation and organization. Jeff Leek emphasizes the importance of well-documented code, advocating for the use of README files and comments within the code to clearly explain its functionality and purpose. These practices are essential for making the code not only usable but also understandable, thereby extending its utility to a broader audience. Detailed documentation ensures that all potential users, regardless of their familiarity with the specific project or dataset, can comprehend and utilize the code effectively.\nMoreover, including comprehensive metadata and descriptive comments can guide users through the logical flow of the code, highlight important variables, and explain complex algorithms. This type of transparency is crucial for collaborative projects and educational purposes, as it allows others to learn from the code and apply the techniques in their own work.\nFor instance, literate programming tools such as knitr for R and Jupyter notebooks for Python and other languages offer powerful ways to integrate code with narrative text. These tools enable researchers to weave a rich, explanatory narrative alongside the code, which is instrumental in elucidating the thought process behind the code and the significance of the results it generates. This approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding but also enhances reproducibility by providing a detailed record of the analysis steps and decision-making processes.\nAdditionally, the use of structured project directories and consistent naming conventions can further improve the accessibility and organization of code. By maintaining a logical and predictable structure, researchers make it easier for others to navigate their projects and locate relevant scripts and data files. Effective organization also supports the sustainability of the code, ensuring that it remains a valuable resource for the scientific community over time.\nIn essence, the diligent documentation and organization of scientific code are foundational to maximizing its impact and longevity. These practices empower researchers to contribute to a cumulative body of knowledge that supports ongoing innovation and discovery in the scientific community.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, the trend towards open science represents a transformative shift in how scientific knowledge is disseminated. As more researchers adopt open practices, the sharing of scientific code is likely to become a norm rather than an exception. This shift holds the promise of making science more inclusive, collaborative, and transparent, leading to more robust and reliable scientific outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe movement towards sharing scientific code is a testament to the evolving ethos of the scientific community, emphasizing openness, collaboration, and the democratization of knowledge.

    "text": "Jeff Leek suggests that while many individuals enter the field of science driven by a desire to contribute to knowledge and society, it’s crucial to not lose sight of career development. The academic environment often places immense emphasis on academic achievements while neglecting the necessity of career strategy. This oversight can leave many brilliant scientists unprepared for the professional challenges that lie beyond the bench and publications.\n\n\n\nLeek emphasizes the need for structured tools and frameworks that assist in the strategic planning of one’s career. He points to a career planning guide developed by his colleague, Ben Langmead, which serves as a crucial resource for postdocs and graduate students. This guide is designed to help individuals reflect systematically on their career aspirations, identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and the steps required to reach their professional goals.\n\n\n\nA fundamental step in effective career planning is setting clear and realistic goals. Early-career scientists are encouraged to define what success means to them personally, which could vary significantly across individuals. Some may envision a tenure-track position at a top university as their pinnacle of success, while others might find their calling in industry, governmental agencies, or non-profit organizations where they can apply scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems.\n\n\n\nLeek also stresses the importance of making the most of available resources. This includes attending career workshops, seeking mentorship, and using platforms like LinkedIn and ResearchGate to showcase one’s work and forge connections with other professionals. Establishing a robust network is crucial—it can lead to collaborative opportunities, insights into various career paths, and potential job offers.\nMoreover, it’s vital to seek out mentors who can provide guidance, feedback, and support.

    "text": "Jeff Leek underscores the importance of a robust social media presence, which encompasses two fundamental components: cultivating a following and leveraging this audience to broaden the impact of your scientific work. The process begins with establishing yourself as a notable figure within the online scientific community. This can be achieved through a variety of strategies:\n\n\nCurating content involves more than sharing articles; it requires selecting high-quality, relevant materials that resonate with your field and your followers. This could include the latest research findings, seminal papers, key conference updates, or important news impacting the scientific community. The goal is to provide value to your audience, making your social media feeds a go-to resource for insightful and impactful information.\n\n\n\nBeyond sharing others’ work, creating original content sets you apart as a thought leader. This could be through writing detailed blog posts, creating informative videos, or even developing infographics that explain complex scientific concepts in simple terms. Original content not only attracts attention but also encourages engagement and sharing, further amplifying your visibility and influence.\n\n\n\nEngagement goes beyond posting content; it involves interacting with your followers, responding to comments, participating in discussions, and even collaborating on social media-driven projects. By engaging, you demonstrate that you are an active member of the community, interested in not just disseminating information but also in learning from and contributing to the discourse. This approach helps build a loyal following that values your contributions and views you as an approachable expert.\n\n\n\nOne of the most engaging forms of content is the discussion of the implications of new research findings.

    "text": "Smart Irrigation Controlling System\n\nUniversity of Westminster, London, United Kingdom (Level 5 - 2nd Year Undergradute)\n\narXiv Preprint | Code\nAbstract: In Sri Lanka, agriculture plays an important role in the development of food production. In our country, agriculture depends on monsoons which are not a sufficient source of water. So irrigation is used in the agriculture field. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a milestone in the evolution of technology. IoT plays an important role in many fields, one of that is Agriculture by which it can feed billions of people on Earth in the future. The objective of this paper is aiming to overcome this challenge, the whole system is microcontroller based and can be operated from a remote location through wireless transmission so there is no need to be concerned about irrigation timing as per crop or soil condition. The sensor is used to take sensor readings of soil like soil moisture, temperature, and air moisture, and decision-making is controlled by the user (farmer) by using a microcontroller. The data received from sensors are sent to the server database using wireless transmission. The irrigation will be automated when the moisture and temperature of the field are reduced. The farmer is notified with the information regarding field conditions through mobile periodically. This system will be more useful in areas where there is a scarcity of water and will be worth efficient in satisfying its requirements.\nIrrigation system features: * remotely controlled water pump * Automatic/manual mode * humidity and water pump status display * Irrigation can be triggered in the Web user interface. In this case, the pump will start for 10s. You can also use the automatic mode. In this case, you set threshold soil humidity in the Web interface. If soil humidity drops below this value pump will switch on for 5s. After 10 min will again check soil moisture and switch the pump on if needed.\nProject Core Technologies Stack: * IoT Cloud - Ubidots IoT cloud Platform * Google Cloud Platform - Google IoT, GCP Firebase * Data Analytics - GCP Analytics, GCP Compute Engine * IoT Platforms - Arduino UNO, ESP8266 NodeMCU Wifi Emmiter * Programming Tech Stack - C++, Android, C++, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JSON, jQuery UI, REST Web Services, Ubidots Cloud Simulator, Java, Python"

    "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious illness that mostly affects the lungs. Tuberculosis bacteria spread from person to person by small droplets sprayed into the air by coughs and sneezes. When someone with untreated, active TB coughs, talks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings, this might happen. Although TB is infectious, it is difficult to catch. You are significantly more likely to catch TB from someone with whom you live or work than from a stranger. Most persons with active tuberculosis who have had adequate medication therapy for at least two weeks are no longer infectious. There are some Tuberculosis infected areas that are small enough to be inviable to the naked eye and Chest X-ray images of Tuberculosis are frequently wrongly categorized with other diseases with similar radiologic patterns, which can lead to patients who received incorrect medication and worsen their health. Although hospitals in Sri Lanka have well-trained and professional personnel, they lack cutting-edge equipment, which may cause the diagnosing process to be slowed. Using cutting-edge techniques like Deep Learning, Image Processing, and Artificial Intelligence, we would be able to create and deploy a system that might affect TB diagnosis in seconds.\n\n\nTuberculosis, Deep Learning - Convolutional Neural Network, Medical Imaging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research study applied a deep learning model to classify the levels of left ventricular ejection fraction using clinical stages data - text data records in nearly 950 echocardiography scan reports from different cardiovascular patients in Cardiovascular Wards. Currently, Cardiologists and Cardiothoracic surgeons are manually reviewing the clinical reports, especially patients’ echocardiography reports to diagnose the cardiovascular clinical stage of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Although, there are several ways have been made to automate this cardiovascular clinical process to extract information from clinical reports, especially from echocardiography reports, currently, there are limited research studies for analyzing cardiovascular clinical trials. This research study focused on establishing some baseline performance measures using a 1- dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and determining strategies for improving classification precision. Currently, we are in the first stage of development of the application. The deep learning model results were promising but were unable to exceed precision or F-scores of 80% for mild, moderate, or severe LVEF; irrespective of how the training data was sampled, how deeply connected the neural network layers were, or well the model was tuned. This solution strongly ropes the need to develop a break-apart algorithm that could help capture conceptual, contextual, and measurement features from the ECHO report.\n\n\nCardiovascular Diseases, Clinical trials, Electronic Health Records (EHR), Echocardiography, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Classification"

The deep learning model results were promising but were unable to exceed precision or F-scores of 80% for mild, moderate, or severe LVEF; irrespective of how the training data was sampled, how deeply connected the neural network layers were, or well the model was tuned. This solution strongly ropes the need to develop a break-apart algorithm that could help capture conceptual, contextual, and measurement features from the ECHO report.\n\n\nCardiovascular Diseases, Clinical trials, Electronic Health Records (EHR), Echocardiography, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Classification"

    "text": "Thesis Abstract\nCardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death around the world and remains a major public health problem. Apart from that, early-stage cardiovascular disease diagnosis and cardiovascular disease prediction also signify a major concern in public health. Most of the time, misdiagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a very common occurrence throughout the world, for cardio specialists. This platform consists with main three main modules, which are web dashboard application, machine learning module, and machine learning web service modules. The machine learning module is based on an Artificial Neural network that was designed using the TensorFlow Machine Learning framework. The web dashboard was designed using the Flask framework and which allows the end user to input clinical variables for diagnosing the process for predicting the cardiovascular risk stage. The machine learning web service module was based on REST web services that handle the request-reply between the ML module and the frontend dashboard. The evaluation of the proposed machine learning classifier model performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) in this research study showed that the proposed model predicted the class label correctly (above 73%). More than seventy-three percent of respondents (including cardio specialists) who participated in the evaluation session agreed strongly agreed that this research followed medical procedures and that the result can support early-stage cardiovascular disease diagnosis analysis."
