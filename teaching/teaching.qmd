## Visiting Lecturer

London, United Kingdom

* Module Leader - 6SENG002W: Concurrent Programming (Level 6) 

**6SENG002W: Concurrent Programming**
**CMT300A / CMT301A: Computer Science Final Project**

As a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Westminster, I was responsible for delivering the 6SENG002W: Concurrent Programming module to undergraduate students. In this role, I designed and delivered engaging lectures, led tutorial classes, and conducted practical sessions to help students develop a deep understanding of this complex and challenging subject matter.

In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I also served as an advisor to final-year research students, providing guidance and support as they pursued projects in a range of research domains related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and other cutting-edge areas. My particular expertise in Medical Informatics, Biomedical Informatics, Health Informatics, Data Science, Multi-Agent Systems, and Gamification made me a valuable resource for students working on projects in these areas.

Throughout my tenure at the University of Westminster, I was committed to fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment that encouraged students to explore and innovate. I worked closely with colleagues and students alike to share knowledge and insights, and to develop new and innovative approaches to teaching and learning.
