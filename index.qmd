<div style="text-align: justify;">
# Welcome!

I am an accomplished graduate with a Special Degree in B.Eng. (Hons) in Software Engineering from the University of Westminster, UK, class of 2019.

With over five years of extensive involvement in research across both industrial and academic settings, I have developed a deep expertise that bridges the gap between hands-on industry applications and advanced academic studies. My professional journey has been marked by significant roles, including that of an Associate Lead Software Engineer, where I honed my skills in engineering research and development, platform engineering, and product development.

Specializing in Enterprise Software Development and Management, my technical proficiencies encompass a broad spectrum, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and ML Ops. These skills are particularly tailored to the demands of enterprise-level software engineering within the competitive landscape of the USA's software industry.

My academic contributions include serving as a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Westminster, and I have played a key role as an Ex-Lead Software Engineer in Research and Development at Virtusa Corporation. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical and Health Informatics at Case Western Reserve University, where my research is focused on cutting-edge topics such as Deep Learning Multi-Model on Genomic Analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), Prompt Engineering, and Clinical Informatics.

I am always open to discussing potential projects or queries related to my field of expertise. With a solid foundation of knowledge and a dynamic set of skills, I am eager to contribute to and collaborate on innovative ventures that push the boundaries of technology and science.


Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.marvinschmitt@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
